# Network Protocol
A network protocol is an established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network.

Essentially, it allows connected devices to communicate with each other, regardless of any differences in their internal processes, structure or design.

### Types of Network Protocol
- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**:
  TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means a connection is established and maintained until the applications at each end have finished exchanging messages.


- **Internet Protocol (IP)**:
  The Internet Protocol is a set of rules for communication over the internet, such as sending mail, streaming video, or connecting to a website. An IP address identifies a network or device on the internet.


- **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**:
  UDP is a communications protocol that is primarily used to establish low-latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications on the internet. UDP speeds up transmissions by enabling the transfer of data before an agreement is provided by the receiving party.


- **Post office Protocol (POP)**:
  The post office protocol (POP) is the most commonly used message request protocol in the Internet world for transferring messages from an e-mail server to an e-mail client. With POP3, the e-mail client requests new messages from the e-mail server, and the server “pops” all new messages out to the client.


- **Simple mail transport Protocol (SMTP)**:
  SMTP is a push protocol and is used to send the mail whereas POP (post office protocol) or IMAP (internet message access protocol) are used to retrieve those emails at the receiver’s side.


- **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**:
  Refers to a group of rules that govern how computers transfer files from one system to another over the internet


- **Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**:
  HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.


- **Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)**:
  Data sent using HTTPS is secured via Transport Layer Security protocol (TLS), which provides three key layers of protection: Encryption: Encrypting the exchanged data to keep it secure from attackers.


- **Telnet (TErminaL NETwork)**:
  Allows you to connect to remote computers (called hosts) over a TCP/IP network (such as the internet). Using telnet client software on your computer, you can make a connection to a telnet server (that is, the remote host)


- **Gopher**:
  The Gopher protocol is a communication protocol designed for distributing, searching, and retrieving documents in Internet Protocol networks.
